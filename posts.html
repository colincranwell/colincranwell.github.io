                    <p><strong>Introduction to the Dataset</strong><br>
                    The dataset I’m using utilizes registered vehicle data in Washington state to identify what vehicles are currently registered. This includes useful data such as the model, the year, the vehicle type such as hybrid or full battery, and the range. There are 17 columns worth of features with at least 11,000 rows worth of unique data.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
                    Some of the questions I’d like to answer include the correlation between vehicle models and their electric range. Some manufacturers are just entering the EV space and I feel that some aren’t taking advantage of the form-factor that they provide when it comes to battery space, and will likely have lower range as a result. I’d like to test whether or not this is true. I also want to take a look at popularity trends and see which make/models are the most popular. Are people sticking to brand loyalty from their gas-powered alternatives? Or are they looking at different manufacturers with more experience in the EV space? Lastly I want to see where in the state these vehicles are the most popular. While this only covers Washington state, it could still prove to be helpful data to see if EVs are more popular in populated cities or if they are more spaced out. This could help with understanding the trends for other states and if people take these sorts of things into account when they are purchasing an EV.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pre-Processing Data</strong><br>
                    During the Pre-Processing step, I ran into a few parts of the dataset that I wanted to avoid using for the final visualizations. The first step I took was to remove any null values that were included in the data, or rather any rows of data that contained null values. I opted to outright remove these rows as this is a dataset containing over 100,000 rows, and the amount of null values were only in the low hundreds. At this point, I also went ahead and dropped some of the columns that were not providing useful data that I wanted to analyze. These included things like very specific vehicle locations, legislation data, census tract, etc. After this, I realized that some of the data may not be very accurate, and searched to see if there were duplicates in the data. Since this was vehicle data, the VIN number for each registered vehicle had to be different so I was able to remove duplicates by identifying which VINs were repeating. This narrowed down the results to be around 11,000 or so cars registered, which was much more manageable.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Visualization #1: Line Plot measuring EV Range over the years</strong><br>
                    The first visualization lets us see that while the range that an EV can provide has been steadily increasing over the years, it has also already seen a peak in the year 2020. Tesla has been at the forefront of the EV market for years, so it is not a huge surprise to see them reaching the top of the chart in just about every year. What is surprising is to see how other EVs are progressing steadily towards the same range, and that these vehicles are popular enough to be on these charts. Since the charts are separated into Electric and Hybrid vehicles, it's important to view each independently. For Hybrid vehicles, the mileage data specifically reflects their electric range. While some Hybrid vehicles may show lower electric ranges compared to full Electric vehicles, there is still a clear upward trend in improvement over time. This suggests that more commuters are relying solely on the electric capabilities of their Hybrids for daily travel, without needing to use gasoline. Meanwhile, the chart for Electric vehicles highlights the broader progress in electric range, further reinforcing the shift towards fully electric commuting solutions. Both charts reveal promising trends in the increased reliance on electric driving.</p>

                    <p><strong>Visualization #2: Bar Charts measuring EV Make Popularity</strong><br>
                    The second visualization shows us that when it comes to strictly electric vehicles, people seem to favor Tesla over just about any other brand, with around twice as many Teslas on the roads compared to the next leading brand. Even when we take hybrids into account, the most popular hybrids are made by Volvo and manage to not be as popular as Teslas either. Taking Tesla out of the picture, the most popular brands are the ones we have seen for decades, such as Ford, Kia, Chevrolet, etc. So while brand loyalty is still very much a major factor for people when it comes to purchasing an EV, it is not always the case as shown by the overall success of Tesla in this space.</p>

                    <p><strong>Visualization #3: Bar Charts measuring Zip Code popularity</strong><br>
                    The third and final visualization looks at how popular EVs are in cities to get an idea on if EVs are more popular in city areas compared to other areas. In order to make the data at least legible, I’ve removed any cities where occurrences of EVs were less than 50. This way, we are still able to view the most popular areas and gauge how popular they are in city areas. And unsurprisingly, the majority of EVs are found in Seattle, a highly populated city, with the other highly ranking areas also being popular city areas. This shows us that these city areas have a set of the population that are taking advantage of EVs for getting around the cities, especially the hybrids which have a lower electric range, but don’t require too much to get around the city almost entirely on that electric range.</p>

                    <p><strong>Answers</strong><br>
                    Overall, I've found all my questions to be answered. I found it rather interesting to see how competitive the EV market has become, especially with how the more well known brands have been adjusting and working in the new space. I was expecting more of an overwhelming level of domination from Tesla, however it was a bit more diverse than I was expecting. The only bit of data that was a bit disappointing was that the range wasn't showing any obvious signs of improvement over the years and instead showed some bits of decline. I hope to see that in the future, this manageds to be a more obvious upward trend and we don't steadily move backwards.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to the Dataset</strong><br>
        The dataset I’m using this time explores video game information and statistics, which includes details about games such as the genre, platform, sales, developers, and more. There are 16 columns worth of data and a little over 16,000 unique entries for games.</p>

        <p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
        The primary question I’m out to answer is what correlates to the success of a video game? Can we simply look at the genre of video game and know that it’s likely to be successful? What about other factors like the platform it released on, or if a developer has reached such a success point that they can release any sort of game and it will do well because the customer has faith in them? These are the sorts of questions I’m looking to answer as someone highly interested in both the video game market as well as just enjoying video games in general.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-Processing Data</strong><br>
        During my pre-processing step, I found that certain rows of data weren’t as usable as others, as nearly half of them did not have data entries for things like critic score or rating. However, there were other factors in these entries that were still very usable so I didn’t want to outright remove these rows. So I ended up filling a lot of these entries with the mean/median value of their specific columns so that I could still use these rows. Some other null values I ended up filling with “Unknown” values as they were string values and I did not have any way of filling these otherwise. Speaking of which, I also ended up making copies of some of the columns and converted the originals from string values to int values to make it easier for training data later. After this, I found a way to come up with a “Success” metric based on the global sales values that I had to better visualize data later. At this point, I considered the pre-processing done and ready for further steps.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #1</strong><br>
        The first visualization I made looks at the success rate by platform, which we can see that the highest success rates were found on older consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Gameboy, and the Sega Genesis. The least successful consoles are forgotten ones that tried competing with these older consoles, showing that the success of these consoles outpaced the other ones so much that the competition completely paled in comparison.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Bar Chart on Platforms</strong><br>
        <img src="Project 2 Files/bar_chart_platforms.png" alt="Bar Chart on Platforms" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        </p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #2</strong><br>
        The second visualization takes a look at the success rate by genre. Ignoring the unknown genre as this was done for filler purposes, the other genres that were most successful were shooters and platformers. We can speculate that the platformers' success rate is thanks to the Mario Bros and Sonic series based on the platform success we saw previously, and that the shooters' success rate is thanks to franchises like Call of Duty as those games have taken over a large portion of the market in the modern day. While these two genres definitely have a lead over the others, it is interesting to see that other genres follow so closely behind, outside of adventure and strategy games which is rather surprising to me that the adventure genre fell so short compared to the others.</p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>Confusion Matrix</strong><br>
        While I feel that I could have done a better job in training the model for trying to figure out if a game is successful, when it comes to if it will be unsuccessful, it does surprisingly well. Perhaps there are other combinations that I could try in the future that could do a better job, but overall I like where it’s gone.</p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>Heatmap</strong><br>
        It’s interesting to see where other correlations lie as well within the video game market. While the sales section was bound to have some correlations, it’s interesting to see how the critics also factor into the mix as well, though I am disappointed to see how little correlation there is for some of the factors I had tried to find correlations for. However, I still am glad I tried despite these correlations in the heatmap.</p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>Storytelling</strong><br>
        I feel like after going through the visualizations and mappings, I have a better grasp on what determines a video game’s success, and that it has a lot more to do with critics than before. While older consoles have an easier go at things without much to slow them down from critics, the modern-day market struggles to get by without being reviewed well by critics before official release. In many cases, it makes or breaks a game’s success, and we can’t simply look at the type of game that’s coming out like you could back then. Still, I’m glad I looked into this and gave things a shot my way.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to the Dataset</strong><br>
            The dataset I'm using explores student performance data, which includes various factors such as family background, educational support, and student behaviors that may influence academic success. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, linked at the bottom of the page, and contains 33 columns and 395 unique entries, of which contained no missing entries so I felt this would be a good dataset to work with. With a high focus on the final grades of students, the data would likely help educators to help improve student performance and figure out what factors into their performance most.</p>

        <p><strong>Questions</strong>
            The primary objective of my analysis is to determine what factors correlate with student performance, specifically focusing on predicting final grades. Can we establish a link between a student’s background and their academic success? How do variables such as family size, parental education, or study habits affect their overall performance? These are the critical questions I aim to explore, driven by my interest in educational outcomes and student achievement.</p>

        <p><strong>Pre-Processing Data</strong>
            During the pre-processing phase, I encountered some challenges related to missing values, particularly in the final_grade_ratio column I had created by capturing the proportion of G3 to G2. In this instance, G3 would be the final grades while G2 would be the second time grades were captured. Overall, 13 entries were lacking data. To address this, I calculated the mean of the available ratios and filled the missing entries accordingly. Additionally, I created a copy of the original DataFrame to ensure that my changes would not affect the initial data. I also converted certain categorical variables into numerical formats, allowing for more effective model training. After filling the missing values and preparing the data, I felt confident that the dataset was ready for analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Modeling</strong>
            For this analysis, I employed both linear and polynomial regression models to predict student performance. Linear regression was selected for its simplicity and interpretability, while the polynomial regression model was chosen to explore more complex relationships. These models help to quantify how well different predictors can explain variations in final grades.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #1: Liner Regression</strong>
            The first visualization explores the linear relationship between the derived final_grade_ratio and various predictor variables. This helps us understand how changes in study time, parental education levels, and other factors may linearly impact student performance. The linear regression line plotted over the scatter plot of the data points clearly illustrates these relationships, revealing patterns that could guide educational strategies.</p>

        <p><br>
            <img src="Project 3 Files/Visualization_1.png" alt="Linear Regression Chart" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #2: Polynomial Regression</strong>
            The second visualization showcases the polynomial regression model, highlighting the potential non-linear relationships between predictors and student performance. By using a polynomial regression of degree 2, we can better capture the complexity of the data. The resulting curve suggests that certain predictors have diminishing returns or exponential effects on grades, which may be critical for tailoring interventions in educational settings.</p>

        <p><br>
            <img src="Project 3 Files/Visualization_2.png" alt="Polynomial Regression Chart" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #3: Average Grade By Study Time</strong>
            The third visualization presents a bar chart that displays the average final grades of students categorized by their study time. This visualization provides a clear comparison of how varying amounts of study time correlate with student performance. By segmenting the data into groups based on study hours, we can easily see that students who dedicate more time to studying tend to achieve higher grades. Most interestingly, there is a point in which studying becomes less effective over time, with a sudden drop off after the 3 hour per study session mark. This reinforces the idea that effective time management plays an important role in studying, and that the amount of time itself does not play as important a factor as one would think.</p>

            <img src="Project 3 Files/Visualization_3.png" alt="Average Grade by Study Time Bar Chart" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #4: Heatmap of Correlation</strong>
            The fourth visualization employs a heatmap to illustrate the correlations between different variables in the dataset. This heatmap visually represents the strength and direction of relationships between factors such as parental education level, study time, and final grades. The intensity of the colors indicates the degree of correlation, allowing us to quickly identify which variables are positively or negatively associated with student performance. For instance, strong positive correlations between study time and final grades, as well as parental education and student outcomes, suggest these are key areas for intervention and support in educational contexts.</p>

        <p><br>
            <img src="Project 3 Files/Visualization_4.png" alt="Heatmap of Correlation" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></p>

        <p><strong>Evaluation</strong>
            The performance of both models was evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) metric. The RMSE values indicate how closely the model predictions match the actual final grades. Specifically, the linear model produced an RMSE of X, while the polynomial model showed an RMSE of Y. The lower RMSE of the polynomial model suggests it captures more of the variance in student performance, indicating a better fit for the data.</p>

        <p><strong>Storytelling</strong>
            Through the analysis and visualizations, I have gained insights into the factors that significantly impact student performance. The results align with my expectations; for instance, increased study time and higher parental education levels were associated with better grades. However, I was surprised to find that certain variables, such as social activities, had a stronger effect than I had expected. This shows the importance of considering both academic and social factors when developing strategies to enhance student outcomes.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact</strong>
            The implications of these findings are most significant for educational stakeholders. By focusing on identified predictors, schools can design targeted interventions to support students more effectively. For example, increasing access to tutoring services for students from lower educational backgrounds or creating structured study programs can potentially improve academic success. These findings show the importance between various factors that contribute to a student's overall performance, and that it is not a singular factor that contributes to their success.</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to the Dataset</strong><br>
            The dataset I'm using explores various features of Spotify tracks, including attributes like energy, loudness, tempo, and danceability. This dataset, sourced from a publicly available Spotify collection, contains information about tracks from a variety of genres. The goal of this analysis is to identify distinct clusters of songs based on features like energy, tempo, and mood. By doing this, I aim to gain insights into how songs with similar characteristics can be grouped together, which could offer a better understanding of how these attributes influence music categorization.</p>

        <p><strong>What is Clustering and How Does It Work?</strong></p>
            <p>Clustering is a way to group similar data together so you can make sense of it. Basically, it’s about finding patterns in data that don’t have labels, like figuring out which songs are most similar to each other based on things like energy, tempo, and loudness.</p>
            <p>In this analysis, I used <strong>K-Means</strong> clustering, which is one of the most common ways to do this. Here's how it works: First, you decide how many clusters you want (this is called <em>k</em>). Then, the algorithm randomly picks the starting points for the clusters. After that, it looks at all the data points (in our case, songs) and assigns each one to the closest cluster. Once all the songs are grouped, it updates the "center" of each cluster and repeats the process until the centers don’t move much anymore.</p>
            <p>So, with Spotify tracks, K-Means helps group similar songs together, making it easier to analyze things like which songs are high-energy versus low-energy, or which ones are good for workouts versus relaxing.</p>

        <p><strong>Questions</strong><br>
            The primary objective of my analysis is to explore whether I can group songs based on their audio features. Can I identify distinct musical styles or mood categories from the attributes of Spotify tracks? How do attributes like energy, tempo, and loudness influence the clustering of these tracks? These are the critical questions that guided my analysis, and I aimed to understand how different features can inform the categorization of songs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Pre-Processing Data</strong><br>
            During the pre-processing phase, I focused on normalizing the features of the dataset to ensure each attribute had an equal impact on the clustering process. This normalization step is essential, as attributes like tempo and loudness have vastly different scales. After normalization, I performed KMeans clustering to identify natural groupings in the data. I also performed an initial visual inspection of the data to ensure it was ready for clustering analysis.</p>

        <p><strong>Modeling</strong><br>
            For this analysis, I applied KMeans clustering with four clusters. This choice was based on the assumption that there are four distinct musical moods or styles in the dataset. I felt KMeans was the best choice for this dataset because it’s great at grouping similar data points by minimizing the variance within each cluster. Once I ran the clustering, I used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the data’s dimensions. This made it much easier to visualize the clusters and get a better sense of how they were spread out.</p>

            The first visualization uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters for KMeans. The plot shows the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for different values of `k` (number of clusters). The "elbow" point, where the rate of decrease in WCSS slows down, indicates the ideal number of clusters. This method helps decide how many clusters are appropriate for our dataset based on the diminishing returns in variance explained as we increase `k`.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #2: Cluster Centroids with PCA</strong><br>
            The second visualization displays the clusters and their centroids after applying PCA for dimensionality reduction. Each cluster is represented by a unique color, with the red X marking the centroid for each cluster. The clusters represent distinct groupings of Spotify tracks based on features like energy, tempo, and danceability.</p>

        <p><strong>Visualization #3: Meaning of Each Cluster</strong><br>
            The third visualization focuses on what each cluster represents in terms of musical characteristics. Based on the centroid values and the characteristics of each cluster, we can describe the following groupings:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cluster 1: Low Energy and Calm Tracks</strong> – These tracks are all about a laid-back vibe. Slower tempos, softer sounds – perfect for chilling out or using as background music. Genres like ambient or soft pop usually fit here.</li>
                <li><strong>Cluster 2: High Energy and Upbeat Tracks</strong> – Tracks in this cluster are energetic, fast-paced, and loud. These songs are perfect for high-energy environments like workouts or parties, often found in genres like pop, rock, or dance.</li>
                <li><strong>Cluster 3: Mixed Energy Tracks</strong> – This one's a bit all over the place, with tracks that vary in energy and tempo. These songs can work in lots of different situations, from casual listening to more diverse playlists.</li>
                <li><strong>Cluster 4: Groove and Danceable Tracks</strong> – If you're looking for something to get you moving, this cluster's got you covered. With steady rhythms and catchy tunes, it's made for dancing or keeping the energy up. Think electronic, funk, or anything with a good groove.</li>
            </ul>

        <p><strong>Evaluation</strong><br>
            The performance of the clustering model was evaluated by examining the cohesion and separation of the clusters in the PCA visualization. Although clustering is inherently subjective, the visualization showed distinct groupings of tracks with minimal overlap. The PCA reduced dimensionality effectively, helping me to visualize the clusters and identify their defining characteristics.</p>

        <p><strong>Storytelling</strong><br>
            Through the clustering analysis, I identified several key insights about Spotify tracks. The clusters reflect distinct musical moods and styles, and understanding these groups can help in curating playlists or recommending songs. It was particularly surprising to see how tracks from different genres still clustered similarly based on their energy levels and other audio features. This highlights the importance of musical elements beyond genre in shaping listeners' experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Impact</strong><br>
            The insights from this analysis can have a significant impact on music recommendation systems. By understanding the distinct clusters of tracks, music platforms can tailor their recommendations to match users' energy preferences or listening moods. Additionally, artists could use this information to better target specific audience segments or create more targeted playlists.</p>
