            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>Hey, my name is Colin (He/They) and I'm a senior in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems. I'm taking this course to fill out my electives for my concentration and I thought data mining sounded very intriguing as a topic to hone in on. My current goal is to survive this final semester and graduate. During the summer I only worked and took summer courses so nothing exciting for me. I'm really into video games, specifically story-based RPGs/JRPGs and I also take an interest in tinkering with networking equipment when I get a chance at work. My Python skills were greatly expanded after taking software engineering last semester so I feel a bit more confident in my abilities in that than in the past.</p>
